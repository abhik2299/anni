Not to exaggerate but it feels like something is broken inside of me. 
No matter how hard I try it feels like I don't have the power to mend it.
or Am I even trying ?
It seems I have given up my control to someone else and they don't even have the faintest idea of it..

My mind is overcrowded,thoughts with no sense of direction running wild but all emanating and terminating at her.
my overthinker friend is making me suffer,it feels so heavy.

I want to unravel the world but the key to the car that starts my journey has been taken away by you.
You are'nt the culprit here beacause I have thrown it away at you.So I don't have it now and you...
"YOU don't even have the faintest idea of it."  

I feel like a garderner who became a slave of thousand thorns just for the love of a 'Rose'.
