Somethings are better left unsaid..
Arranging those feelings in the correct array of words is rather tedious than comforting.

With numerous possiblities like you coming short of words, or unable to express your thoughts the way it sounded in your mind,
then ultimately expressing out totally different sense of meaning from the one you intended it to be.

Eventually this becomes a taboo for your mental peace for quite a long time 'pushing you into a valley of regret' and
your inner voice shouting loudly over and over again 
"You shouldn't have done that.You shouldn't have said that.You dumb asshole...."

And the moment you thought,would cherish for a never ending time becomes a bane to your existence.
